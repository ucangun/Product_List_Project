# Product_List_Project

https://umutproductlistwithreact.netlify.app/

## Project Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to enhance and demonstrate my skills in React by fetching and displaying data from a JSON file (`data.js`). This project also aims to provide hands-on experience with Sass, focusing on its modular structure. The application showcases a list of products using React components and styled with Sass.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content and layout of the application.
- **CSS**: Employed for basic styling before enhancing with Sass.
- **Sass**: Used for modular and advanced styling, focusing on features like variables, mixins, and nesting.
- **React**: Implemented for building the user interface. Key React features include:
  - Creating and managing components using JSX
  - Fetching data from a local JSON file
  - Passing data through props to different components
  - Organizing the project with React's file structure

### At the end of the project, will be able to;

This project has significantly contributed to my understanding and mastery of React and Sass. By developing this product list application, I have gained practical experience in creating and managing React components, fetching and displaying data, and utilizing Sass for styling. This foundational knowledge will be essential for more advanced web development projects in the future.
